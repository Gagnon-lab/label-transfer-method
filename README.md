scRNA-seq Label Transfer Method 

A computational method to transfer labels from a reference cell atlas to an unlabeled single-cell data set.

The method begins with two inputs, a reference cell atlas containing the top markers that establish a cell type and the highly differentiated markers that establish each unlabeled cluster of a single-cell dataset. The computational framework was designed to compare the markers of each of the two inputs to one another in order to find the most likely cell type for each unlabeled cluster.
